she heeded his oboes 
he hooded his ibises 
he slid his hills 
he slid his high isles  
lo his bold edges  
he bled his loose bills  
shh his good gills  
so beeps blooie bible  
I zipped his soiled pods  
shh his idle holes his bibbed globs  
he espied his oiled geese 
so goes bold sigh, deep hissed 
deep so good solo
loose good deep deep diddle
he sighed his shod hoboes 
pop pop big high seed
shh deep oboes, his pissed ill ills 
she zipped his shod pigs
